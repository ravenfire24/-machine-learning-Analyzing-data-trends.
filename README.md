# Sales Data Trend Analysis Using Python and Scikit-Learn
Python-based machine learning models leveraging scikit-learn to analyze sales data trends.

## Step 1: Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can check by running
  ```bash
  python –version
- Version 3
  ```bash
  python3 –version
- Install pip, Python's package manager, if not already installed. You can check with
  ```bash
  pip –version
- Verison 3
  ```bash
   pip3 --version
## Step 2: Install scikit-learn
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to install scikit-learn
  ```bash 
  pip install scikit-learn
## Step 3: Verify Installation
- After the installation is complete, verify it by opening a Python interactive shell:
  ```bash
    python
- Import scikit-learn and check its version
  ```bash
  import sklearn
  print(sklearn.__version__)
- If no errors appear and the version is printed, scikit-learn is successfully installed.
## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter permission issues, try
  ```bash
  pip install scikit-learn –user
- For compatibility issues, ensure pip is updated:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip
