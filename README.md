# Sales Data Trend Analysis Using Python and Scikit-Learn
This project demonstrates the use of Python and scikit-learn to build machine learning models that analyze and predict sales trends. By leveraging a simple dataset, we explore how marketing spend, seasonal effects, and time impact sales.

## Overview
The project includes the following steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: Loading sample sales data into a DataFrame, cleaning, and feature selection.
2. **Model Training**: Using a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn to predict sales.
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance with R² accuracy metrics.
4. **Prediction**: Predicting sales based on new input data
   
## Step 1: Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can check by running
  ```bash
  python –-version
- Version 3
  ```bash
  python3 –-version
- Install pip, Python's package manager, if not already installed. You can check with
  ```bash
  pip –-version
- Verison 3
  ```bash
   pip3 --version
## Step 2: Install scikit-learn
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to install scikit-learn
  ```bash 
  pip install scikit-learn
## Step 3: Verify Installation
- After the installation is complete, verify it by opening a Python interactive shell:
  ```bash
    python
- Import scikit-learn and check its version
  ```bash
  import sklearn
  print(sklearn.__version__)

## Step 4: install pandas and numpy
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
